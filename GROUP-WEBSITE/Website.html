            <div class="content-text">
            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run on the internet or intranet. It combines programming, design, and user experience to build interactive and dynamic sites. Here are the main areas of web development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: Involves creating the visual elements of a website that users interact with directly. Key technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>Back-End Development</strong>: Focuses on the server-side of the website. Technologies include languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, and frameworks like Node.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Development</strong>: A full-stack developer works on both the front-end and back-end, enabling them to build complete web applications from start to finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Frameworks</strong>: Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js make front-end development faster and more efficient. Back-end frameworks like Django, Express.js, and Laravel streamline server-side development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The modern web is constantly evolving, and staying updated on the latest frameworks and technologies is key to becoming a successful web developer.</p>
